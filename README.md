### ✅ **Why "Undeposited Funds" is used when a customer pays you in QuickBooks:**

When a customer **pays you**, but you **haven’t deposited the money into your bank yet**, QuickBooks uses the **“Undeposited Funds”** account to temporarily hold that payment.

---

### 🔄 Think of it like this:

You receive **cash**, a **check**, or an **online payment** — but instead of putting it straight into the bank, it goes into your **drawer** or **waiting-to-be-deposited folder**.

---

### ✅ Example:

**Customer pays \$750 for property maintenance**, but you haven’t deposited it yet.

| Date       | Account                | Debit    | Credit   |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| 07/18/2025 | **Undeposited Funds**  | \$750.00 |          |
| 07/18/2025 | **Maintenance Income** |          | \$750.00 |

> 🔹 **Debit Undeposited Funds** → Increases the asset of money “on hand”
> 🔹 **Credit Income** → Recognizes the revenue earned

---

### 🏦 Later, when you deposit the \$750 into the bank:

| Date       | Account               | Debit    | Credit   |
| ---------- | --------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| 07/19/2025 | **Checking**          | \$750.00 |          |
| 07/19/2025 | **Undeposited Funds** |          | \$750.00 |

> 🔹 **Debit Checking** → You now have the cash in the bank
> 🔹 **Credit Undeposited Funds** → Clearing out the temporary account

---

### 🔁 Summary:

* **Undeposited Funds** is a **holding account**.
* It's used when you receive payments but don’t deposit them **immediately**.
* It helps match your **bank deposit slip** to actual QuickBooks entries when you do the **bank deposit**.
